		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<a href="assets/images/shotgun.jpg"><img src="assets/images/Shotgun.jpg" alt="profile pic" id = "profPic"></a>
		<p>My name is Daniel Kang. I kind of know how to use Facebook and I like video games.</p>
		<p>I am a problem maker, not a problem solver, so I hope to be able to change that in this class.</p>
		<p>I am taking this class to make cool stuff and not break anything too valuable, hopefully.</p>
		<p>I also kind of know how to use Gmail, and the occassional Skype conversation, but anything beyond that is too much for me.</p>
		<p>I think this class can really help me learn how to use a computer and maybe the internet.</p>
		<p>After doing the prework, I was able to improve my typing speed dramatically.</p>
		<p>I was able to improve from 4WPM to at least 25WPM, so I can see rapid improvement already. And hopefully, I can improve that to 25SPM(Sentences Per Minute).</p>
